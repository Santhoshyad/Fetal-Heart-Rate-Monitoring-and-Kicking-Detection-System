# Fetal-Heart-Rate-Monitoring-and-Kicking-Detection-System
It is a system of detecting and monitoring heart rate at the fetal stage and also at later stages kicking detection too. This system is based on ATmega328P microcontroller where it monitors and displays all the data collected by sensors interfaced on it and also transmits the readings when needed or in Emergency conditions!

**COMPONENTS USED**
ATmega328P Microcontroller
EMG sensors and Microphone
GSM Module

Interfacing Instructions
All the components are interfaced based on all the pins available in microcontroller and the same needs to be used in the code
